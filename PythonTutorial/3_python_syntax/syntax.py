# Python Indentation

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")


# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

# if 5 > 2:
#  print("Five is greater than two!")
#         print("Five is greater than two!")

# Python Variables
