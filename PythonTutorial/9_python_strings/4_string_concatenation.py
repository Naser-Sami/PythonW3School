# Python - String Concatenation

# String Concatenation
# To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)


# To add a space between them, add a " ":
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)


# Exercise
# What is a correct syntax to merge variable x and y into variable z?
# z = x + y


# What will be the result of the following code:
x = 'Welcome'
y = 'Coders'
print(x + y)    # WelcomeCoders


# Consider this code:
a = 'Join'
b = 'the'
c = 'party'
# What is a correct syntax to print 'Join the party'?
print(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c)
